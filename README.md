## What is this book about?
Unreal Engine 4 is a powerful game engine, one which has seen a recent boost in widespread adoption thanks to its ease of use and the powerful rendering pipeline that it packs. Seeing as how it's relatively easy to create stunning presentations and visuals, Unreal has quickly become a strong contender in industries where this kind of software had been previously denied entry.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Master Unreal Engine's rendering pipeline for developing real-time graphics
* Use physically based rendering (PBR) for building materials and lighting solutions
* Build optimized materials for games targeting multiple platforms
* Understand Unreal Engine's node and functions for creating desirable effects
* Design and build production-ready shaders
